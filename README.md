# Customer Segmentation - Clustering ðŸŽ¯
### Inspiration
Drawing inspiration from an online analysis, this project delves into customer segmentation. Replicating essential elements, I navigated through the steps akin to real-world projects, allowing me to further refine and adapt my approach

## Project Overview
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, showcasing the "Customer Segmentation through Clustering" project. Drawing inspiration from a similar project found online, I embarked on this journey to not only replicate the analysis but also elevate it to a more sophisticated level suitable for professional applications in my work. The project leverages essential Python librariesâ€”NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Yellowbrickâ€”forming a robust toolkit for advanced data analysis and visualization.

Delve into the intricacies of data analysis with a particular focus on clustering, incorporating the following components:

- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Data Preprocessing
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering (The Elbow Method, KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering model)
- Evaluating Models
- Profiling

Explore the code and documentation to gain a profound understanding of the project's intricacies. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable, contributing to the ongoing refinement of this endeavor! ðŸš€
